/**
 * Reproducible runtime install for the DeepSeekGUI distribution.
 *
 * The staging consumer installs local tarballs plus their external registry
 * dependencies. Local tarballs are rebuilt from the repository every run, so
 * their resolution is trivially reproducible; the floating part is the
 * external semver ranges. The build therefore keeps npm's lockfile enabled,
 * seeds the staging install with the committed
 * `apps/deepseekgui/runtime.package-lock.json`, and writes the result back — npm
 * holds every external dependency at its locked version while ranges still
 * allow it, so two builds from the same commit install the same external set.
 * For the lockfile to be committable it must be machine-portable: local
 * tarballs are referenced with relative `file:` specs, and this module's check
 * rejects any absolute path that would tie the lockfile to one build machine.
 * @module scripts/runtime-lock
