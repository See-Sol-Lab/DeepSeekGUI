/**
 * Sanitize and leak-scan the packaged distribution.
 *
 * Files are read once: any occurrence of the build machine's repository root
 * (either slash form) is replaced with a neutral token, then the file is
 * checked for leaked user content. Filename checks (`.git`, `.env`, session
 * logs) and the building user's home path run over the whole tree; API-key
 * patterns are only meaningful in files this repository produces (our
 * packages and the app bundle), since upstream npm package docs legitimately
 * contain `sk-…`-shaped examples. Every text file is read in full — no size
 * cutoff — because a skipped file is a silent hole in exactly the guarantee
 * this scan exists to give; a file that cannot be read is reported as a
 * finding for the same reason.
