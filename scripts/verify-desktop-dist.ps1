#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify-desktop-dist.ps1 -ReportPath dist\desktop\acceptance-report.txt
# With -ReportPath the identity facts this script already reads (app version,
# embedded DSH version, source commit) are written as an acceptance report, so
# CI does not re-implement the same three lookups in workflow YAML.
# Runs the packaged exe in smoke mode (DSH_DESKTOP_SMOKE=1) with a PATH that
# contains no Node.js/pnpm/npm directories, reads the real exit code via
# Start-Process -Wait -PassThru (a GUI exe run with `&` reports an empty
# $LASTEXITCODE), then asserts the DSH child exited and port 3080 is released.
# Smoke mode closes the window itself only after the UI loaded, so exit 0 plus
# a released port plus zero leftover processes proves the load succeeded.
