/**
 * Version skew between an Existing Home's profile modules and the DSH runtime
 * DeepSeekGUI ships.
 *
 * A profile under a user's own `~/.dsh` carries whatever DSH packages the tool
 * that created it installed. DeepSeekGUI boots that profile against its own
 * bundled runtime, so the two module trees meet inside one Node realm. When
 * they are the same version this is invisible; when they are not, the failure
 * mode is a tool call dying on `Cannot read properties of undefined` because a
 * service key is a plain `Symbol()` — never `Symbol.for` — and two copies of a
 * package never produce equal symbols. That crash names nothing that would
 * lead a user (or the agent helping them) back to this directory.
 *
 * So DeepSeekGUI reads the skew and states it as a fact. It does not block: the
 * user's own Home is theirs, mixed versions often work, and a modal that fires
 * on a maybe teaches people to dismiss modals. Recording it means the agent
 * inside DeepSeekGUI can answer "why did my tool call just die" with the actual
 * reason instead of guessing.
